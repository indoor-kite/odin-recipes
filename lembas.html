	<h1>Lembas bread</h1>
    <img src="lembas.png">
    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>One bite will satisfy a man for a day!</p>
    <p> Elven Lembas bread, also called Way bread, was a special type of bread or cake made by the Elves in Tolkien’s books. 
        It was pocket-sized and exceedingly nutritious. It stayed fresh for months when wrapped in leaves, 
        and was a type of superfood carried along on long journeys. Think super-powered energy bars. </p>
  <h2>Ingredients</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>1 cup butter</li> 
    <li>1/2 cup brown sugar or 1/4 cup honey</li>
    <li>2 cups unbleached flour</li>
</ul> 
  <h2>Instructions</h2> 
  <ol>
    <li>Preheat oven to 325 degrees.</li>
    <li>Cream together the butter and sugar or honey.</li>
    <li>Add the flour and mix until thoroughly incorporated.</li>
    <li>Put out on suitable surface and knead until quite smooth,
         about 5 minutes, adding a bit of flour if necessary to keep dough from sticking.</li>
    <li>Roll out to about ¼ inch thickness and cut into 3" to 4" squares,
         scoring with a knife halfway through each square with a butter knife. </li>
    <li>Place on buttered cookie sheet and bake for about 20 to 25 minutes, or until lightly golden brown.</li>
  </ol>
